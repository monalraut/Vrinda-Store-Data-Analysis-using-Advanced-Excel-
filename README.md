# Vrinda Store Data Analysis using Advanced Excel

Welcome to the Vrinda Store Data Analysis project! 🎉

📅 Dataset of Vrinda Store is in Excel file.

🔍 I have created an annual sales report using advanced excel to understand their customers.

📊 I have Performed data cleaning, data processing, data analysis, data visualization with the use of pivot tables and generated
valuable insights.

🌱Let's see what insights I have gathered. 

💠Insights - 
1) The more orders were placed in March,2022 therefore the total sale is highest in the month of March whereas lower sales is in the month of November, 2022. Vrinda store can try to boost their sales from September to December months by offering discounts etc.
2) Women are more likely to buy compared to men. (~65%)
3) Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states contributing more in sales. Vrinda store should focus on other states too by advertising products in the city.
4) Customers are ordering more from Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
5) Final Conclusion - Target women customers from the age of (30-49) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads, offers, coupons available on Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart to improve the sales but we should not ignore other states and channel. Vrinda store should come up with more exciting ads on the different city to attract more customers.
